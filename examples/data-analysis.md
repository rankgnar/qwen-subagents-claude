# Example: Data Analysis Script

This example shows how to use the Qwen3-Coder Claude Bridge for creating data analysis scripts.

## Scenario

You need to process a CSV file containing sales data and generate summary reports with visualizations.

## Using the Bridge

1. **Data Processing**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Create a Python script to read CSV sales data and calculate monthly totals"
   ```

2. **Data Visualization**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Add matplotlib visualizations to show sales trends over time"
   ```

3. **Report Generation**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Generate a PDF report with summary statistics and charts"
   ```

4. **Optimization**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Optimize the script for handling large datasets efficiently"
   ```

## Switching Models

For documentation of your analysis:
```bash
claude "Write technical documentation for the sales data analysis script"
```

For quick testing:
```bash
qwen "Test the CSV reading function with sample data"
```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of the bridge for different types of development tasks.
