# Example: Web Application Development

This example demonstrates how to use the Qwen3-Coder Claude Bridge for developing a web application.

## Scenario

You want to create a new React application with TypeScript and Redux, including a responsive design and API integration.

## Using the Bridge

1. **Start with Planning**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Create a new React application with TypeScript and Redux for a task management system"
   ```

2. **Implement Components**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Create a responsive TaskList component with drag-and-drop functionality"
   ```

3. **API Integration**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Implement API integration with error handling for a RESTful task management service"
   ```

4. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   ccr code "Write unit tests for the TaskList component using Jest and React Testing Library"
   ```

## Benefits of Using Subagents

- **Planner**: Helps break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Coder**: Generates clean, efficient code following best practices
- **Reviewer**: Reviews code for potential issues and suggests improvements

This approach ensures a professional development workflow with intelligent assistance at every step.
